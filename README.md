## Introduction
A real-time collaborative text editor: Google Docs for code

Our project is a real-time collaborative text editor.
 It allows you to host a server containing a project and give your team the ability to edit the files in this project together.
This editing happens in real-time and you can see the editing of your team in real-time.

Our project is a real-time collaborative text editor, intended for programming in teams. The editor allows you to collaboratively edit the same file as your team members and enables you to see each otherâ€™s changes in real time, as they are written. As such, a group of programmers can work together efficiently, using the immediate feedback from the work of others to solve programming tasks quickly and in an organised manner.
