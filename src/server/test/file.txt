The project we propose is a real-time collaborative (code) editor based a
centralized self-hosted server infrastructure. The two main components will
be a client-side application used to interact with the project files and a
server-side application which will be responsible for hosting the files
and coordinating the real-time collaboration between the various connected
clients.

Since this editor is meant for collaborative projects, we want to focus on
implementing specific features supporting a collaborative coding effort.
We believe that, given the numerous discrete parts that can be added to our
minimum viable product, our proposed project is suitable for a group of our
size. We have specified multiple stretch-goals as well in case the minimal
product is working properly and we have some time left for implementing
more sophisticated features.
