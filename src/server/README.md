# Setup
You need to compile and install this library: ![libxtcommon_v1.0.1](https://github.com/XenoTech-Inc/libxtcommon/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
Only linux and windows (with cygwin) are supported!

See ./build --help for information. This should be sufficient in most cases:
  ./build -r -l x64
  sudo make install
